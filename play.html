    <h2>As You Like It</h2>
    <h3> SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.</h3>
    <h6>Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</h6>
    <h6> CELIA</h6>
    I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
    <h6>ROSALIND</h6>
     <p>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
    and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
    teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
    learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.</p>
    <h6>CELIA</h6>
    <p>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
    that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
    had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
    hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
    love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
    if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
    tempered as mine is to thee.</p>
    <h6>ROSALIND</h6>
    <p>I will forget the condition of my estate, to
    rejoice in yours.</p>
    <h6>CELIA</h6>
    <p>You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
    like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
    be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
    father perforce, I will render thee again in
    affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
    that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
    sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</p>
    <h6>ROSALIND</h6>
    <p>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
    me see; what think you of falling in love?</p>
    <h6>CELIA</h6>
    <p>I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
    love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
    neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
    in honour come off again.</p>
    <h6>ROSALIND</h6>
    <p>shall be our sport, then?</p>
    <h6>CELIA</h6>
    <p>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
    her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</p>
    <h6>ROSALIND</h6>
    <p>would we could do so, for her benefits are
    mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
    doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</p>
    <h6>CELIA</h6>
    <p>'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
    makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
    makes very ill-favouredly.</p>
    <h6>ROSALIND</h6>
    <p> now thou goest from Fortune's office to
    Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
    not in the lineaments of Nature.
    Enter TOUCHSTONE</p>
    <h6>CELIA</h6>
    <p>No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
    not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
    hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
    Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?</p>
    <h6>ROSALIND</h6>
    <p>there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
    Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
    Nature's wit.</p>
    <h6>CELIA</h6>
    <p>Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
    Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
    to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
    natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
    the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
    wit! whither wander you?</p>
    <h6>TOUCHSTONE</h6>
    <p>you must come away to your father.</p>
    <h6>CELIA</h6>
    <p>Were you made the messenger?</p>
    <h6>TOUCHSTONE</h6>
    <p>No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.</p>
    <h6>ROSALIND</h6>
    <p>learned you that oath, fool?</p>
