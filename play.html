        Act 1, Scene 1: Orchard of Oliver's house

    <h4>
        SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house
    </h4>
    Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
    <h4>ORLANDO</h4>
    <h6>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
which his animals on his dunghills are as much
bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</h6>
<h4>ADAM
</h4>
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
<h4>ORLANDO
    </h4>
    Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
shake me up.
Enter OLIVER
<h4>OLIVER </h4>
Now, sir! what make you here?
<h4>
    ORLANDO
Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
